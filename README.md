* Perform data cleaning/deal with missing values using Pandas and NumPy.
* Plot interactive graphs to understand the data using visual libraries like matplotlib and hvplot.
* Ask and Answer questions from the dataset.


# 3 Questions to be answered
1. Which cities in Washington have the most electric and hybrid cars registered?
2. What is the ratio of cars to chargers in the selected cities? 
    - fast/slow charging ports
3. Do the most popular car models in the selected cities have federal rebate?

# Analysis

Based on the data, one should buy an electric in the state of Washington other than the city of Seattle. 

If one is living in Seattle, one should buy a Plug-in Hybrid as there are total 73 charger stations near Seattle of which 52 are slow chargers and there are a total of 26932 EV cars.
